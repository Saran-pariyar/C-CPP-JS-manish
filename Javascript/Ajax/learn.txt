// synchronous &  Asynchronous programming 
Note:
 1. Synchronous code will execute line by line only. 
 2. Asynchronous code doesn't wait the above code to execute before executing itself 
 3. AJAX = Asynchronous Javascript & XML

 (We can do asynschronous programming with setTimeOut function)

 AJAX allows to communicate with remote server in an asynschronous way. With ajax calls, we can  request data from web servers dynamically.
